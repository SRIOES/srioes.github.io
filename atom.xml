<pre><code>  Who am I?
  I’m GregoriusT.
  Where I am?
  I think that I am in a new planet, called GTNH. The natural environment here is greatly comfortable. Here are also animals, plants and the same science rules as the Earth, but I haven’t seen anybody so far. And...why I know these things?
  I am a realist. It’s necessary for me to throw away all the feelings in mind,because actions are always the most important things. Here’s no anybody doesn’t means there will be no anybody, go and take action.
  My first task will be to find food, and look for a suitable home to live. In my mind, the night will  have complete darkness. I run about three kilometers and pick some berries in a forest, then collect some of fruits to be as dinner. There is a river nearby, the gravel by the river is always hard, so I decide to select a few flints as simple tools. Three hours goes by, the night is coming. I am still working, but suddenly feel something dangerous is probably moving close to me. I shout at the front with tons of fear, then run into the forest soon and put lots of branches and leaves to hide myself. All the things with colors can’t be seen because of darkness, I can only hear some strange sounds outside, like”waaaaa...wroooo...” or  “sssss...”. Who are they? Are they my enemies? I don’t know.
  Later, I finally fall asleep in such an uncomfortable place. I can have a sweet dream.
